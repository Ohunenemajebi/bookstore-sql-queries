# Online Bookstore Database Project

Welcome to the Online Bookstore Database Project repository. This project demonstrates a simple SQL database for an online bookstore and includes SQL scripts for creating tables, inserting sample data, and running common bookstore operations.

## Project Overview

This project showcases SQL database management skills, including schema design, data insertion, and querying. The database models an online bookstore with tables for books, authors, customers, orders, and order details. Included are sample SQL queries for common bookstore operations.

## Table of Contents

- [Database Schema](#database-schema)
- [Inserting the Data](#Inserting-the-Data)
- [SQL Queries](#sql-queries)

  
## Database Schema

The database schema includes the following tables:

- `Books`
- `Authors`
- `Customers`
- `Orders`
- `OrderDetails`

Please refer to the `Create_Tables.sql` file for the schema details.

## Inserting the Data

The `Insert_Data.sql` file contains SQL statements to populate the database tables with sample data for the Online Bookstore Database Project. It is an essential component of the project, as it provides the initial data required for testing and querying the database.

### Table Data Included

- **Authors:** Sample author information is inserted, including author names.
- **Customers:** Sample customer data is added, including customer names and email addresses.
- **Books:** Information about sample books is inserted, such as book titles, authors, genres, and prices.
- **Orders:** Sample order data is added, including order dates and total order amounts.
- **OrderDetails:** This table stores details about individual book purchases in each order, including the book's quantity and price.

## SQL Queries
Explore the project's SQL queries in the SQL_Queries.sql file. These queries cover common bookstore operations, including book searches, sales analysis, order processing, and more.
